# R studio shortcuts and misc tips

### Go to file/function
CTRL + .
or
F2 on top of the function name

### Find in files
Search under a file tree for matches in the files
CTRL + SHIFT + f

### Navigate the path
Whenever we write some "" and automcomplete, we will navigate through the filesystem (and can use ..) and quickly locate and reference a file.

### Folding
cmd-alt-L         collapse
shift-cmd-alt-L   expand
cmd-alt-O         collapse all
shift-cmd-alt-O   expand all

### Notebooks
- Previewing the document as html_document is not the same as knitting it. It simply generates an html version of what you already have in the notebook.
- Using SQL chunks. In the options you can pass the conn and the R object that is going to hold the results. The params are passed as ?param in the SQL code. And are any R variable previously defined. 
TODO: Try with HIVE and odbc please! and impala as well :-D

### Fuzy search
- When autocompleting you can tipe the letters not necesearily consecutive (example 'insh' >> 'install_github').

### Console history
- When typing on the console, cmd-up shows all history commands that match what you have already typed. Never write things twice!

### Visualise jsons
> devtools::install_github("hrbrmstr/jsonview")
> library(jsonview)
> json_view(r)
> json_tree_view(r)

### Java stuff
Sometimes there are synch problems with Java (failure to load rJava package for example). Most of them are solved by simply:
$ R CMD javareconf
