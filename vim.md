C-]			Jump into the tag
C-t			Come back from the tag

## Spell

set spell		Enable spellchecking
set nospell		Disable spellchecking

set spell spelllanguage=ca,en_us	 Languages should already been predefined at the vimrc, but if not, simply:

`]s`			move to the NEXT misspelled word
`[s`			move to the PREVIOUS misspelled word

z= 			List of suggested alternatives.

zg 			Add word to dictionary

This adds the word to a spellfile located by default at .config/nvim/spell where all the added words are stored and are loaded together with the main dictionary. It's a ood idea to keep this (actually the whole nvim folder) in same repo to never lose this work.
Misspelled words are highlighted. If you are not comfortable with the default highlight colors you can change them:

hi clear SpellBad
hi SpellBad cterm=underline

## Scripting

scriptnames		Lists all the scripts in order as they are sourced during startup

## Word counting

gC-g			Count words from a block of text.

## Moving around

Move through the jump list:

C-O (back) C-I (fwd)

Show jump list:
  
ju

Moving through the change list:

  g; (back) g, (fwd)

Show changes list:

  :changes

## Editing

  :set paste
  :set nopaste

## Surround

  yss-

## Browser

,b

## Python REPL - iron.vim

#  Navigating with ctags  #
---------------------------

By default, Mac OSX somes with a BSD flavour of ctags. It's better to install Exhuberant CTags with:

$ brew install ctags

From the command line indexing a whole folder is something as simple as:

> ctags -R .

This generates a tags file with the index.

To tell vim where to find the tags file we need to set the path to it:

:set tags=tags,./tags,./.tags

We can then manually execute ctags to generate the index for our current project by running:

:!ctags -R

We can force to rerun ctags every time we save a file by:

:autocmd BufWritePost * call system("ctags -R")

However, a neater approach is to add a hook to your git global configuration so that is reruns ctags 
everytime we commit. All the details are explained at https://tbaggery.com/2011/08/08/effortless-ctags-with-git.html

In a nutshell:

$ git config --global init.templatedir '~/.git_template'
$ mkdir -p ~/.git_template/hooks
Inside this last folder create the following executable:
    #!/bin/sh
    set -e
    PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
    dir="`git rev-parse --git-dir`"
    trap 'rm -f "$dir/$$.tags"' EXIT
    git ls-files | \
      ctags --tag-relative -L - -f"$dir/$$.tags"
    mv "$dir/$$.tags" "$dir/tags"

This will create a .git/tags file anytime we commit something to the repo. 
We then need to create three execs hooks (post-commit, post-merge and post-checkout) at ~/.git_template/hooks with:
    #!/bin/sh
    .git/hooks/ctags >/dev/null 2>&1 &
And a fourth (post-rewrite) with:
    #!/bin/sh
    case "$1" in
      rebase) exec .git/hooks/post-merge ;;
    esac
Then we can reload them in our git project (if it already exists) by running:
$ git init
This will copy the hooks inside .git.

Let's see how we can use the tags.

Jump to a tag by looking up the name
:tag name

If we have a fuzzy searcher such as fzf already installed we can use it to search through the tags:
:Tags (or the remapped <leader>t)  

Using the CTRL-] command you can jump to a tag under your cursor.

Using the tag stack, which is a list of tag-based locations you have visited. After following some tags, you can trace back through your history with :pop or CTRL-T and forward with :tag (each take an optional count). To see your history, you can use :tags. This works much like Vimâ€™s regular CTRL-I and CTRL-O commands for the jump list, but the tag stack only contains, well, tags.

Tagbar is a Vim plugin that provides an easy way to browse the tags of the current file and get an overview of its structure. It does this by creating a sidebar that displays the ctags-generated tags of the current file, ordered by their scope. This means that for example methods in C++ are displayed under the class they are defined in.
