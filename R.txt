= General

- Shortcut for the pipe operator in RStudio
Ctrl-Shift-M

- The %in% operator
> "a" %in% c("a","b","c")

>= Packages

- Generate roxygen documentation
> devtools::document()

- Browse all Vignettes from the installed packages from localhost (no need to be online!)
> browseVignettes()

- Sometimes devtools::install_git has credential problems. In that case we need to explicitly pass the credentials:
devtools::install_git("https://github.int.midasplayer.com/STO-BPU/aggrigatoR", credentials = git2r::cred_user_pass(username = "xavier.guardiola", password = "XXX"))

= dplyr

- Standard ifelse drops date classes and factor levels

Something like x = ifelse(!is.na(start_date), start_date, start_date + 1) makes x a double. To prevent this (expected) behaviour we can use dplyr's alternative: if_else() that keeps the class.

- Case when (switch)
> mtcars %>% 
  mutate(cg = case_when(carb <= 2 ~ "low",
                        carb > 2  ~ "high"))

- Apply a function row by row:
> data %>%
> rowwise() %>%
> mutate(x = function(y))

- Normalise all values with the first 
data_funnel %>%
  mutate(perc = players / players[stage == 'Assigned'])

= ggplot2

- If we want the plot to include the 0 without having to explicit the limits (as in c(0, max(smtg)). We can do it in two ways: either:
> + geom_hline(yintercept = 0)
or
> + expand_limits(y = 0)

R doesn’t stop you from shooting yourself in the foot, but as long as you don’t aim the gun at your toes and pull the trigger, you won’t have a problem.
